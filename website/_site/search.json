    "text": "The present state of the economy (as of May 2023) is uncertain at best, with some bearish analysts warning of recession while others claim it‚Äôs business as usual. A recent Forbes advisor article tracked 15 market performance metrics and rated 3 as good, 4 as neutral, and 8 as bad. Two conflicting consumer confidence surveys were listed - one rated good, the other rated bad. On the other hand, a recent nerdwallet article dated May 3rd plainly states that ‚ÄúAccording to a traditional definition, the U.S. is not currently in a recession.‚Äù\nI am not an economist; rather, I am a graduate student at Georgetown University‚Äôs Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) program. Since I will need to find a job after I graduate, I‚Äôd like to understand the current state of the job market for data scientists. Rather than break out the machine learning algorithms to try and predict where the economy is going, I think creating some visualizations using the data provided for our mini-project might give us an intuitive sense of how the data science market looks like right now. At the very least, I hope to answer a few questions that I‚Äôve had when trying to navigate job postings.\nThe data provided for this mini-project comes from a web-crawling exercise that involved searching for jobs using 11 different terms on April 14th, 2023. These search terms were:\n\ndata scientist\ndata analyst\nneural networks\nbig data and cloud computing\nmachine learning\nreinforcement learning\ndeep learning\ntime series\ntime series analysis (combined with time series)\nblock chain\nnatural language processing\n\nThe searches were also divided into two categories based on their location: nationwide, and here in Washington, D.C. You can see a sample job posting below:\n \n\nScreenshot of an example job posting. Many postings list several qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.\n\n\nThere were a total of 823 unique job postings. From these postings, there were 458 unique job titles, which leads me to my first question."

    "text": "üï∏Ô∏è Untangling The Web of Job Titles\nGiven the vast number of job titles - and 11 different search categories - I wondered which jobs I might qualify for with my degree. I‚Äôve often heard that data science graduates are prepared for a wide variety of jobs, and not to limit oneself only to jobs entitled ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù. To this end, I focused on the ‚ÄúQualifications‚Äù and ‚ÄúResponsibilities‚Äù sections of a the job posting. I used a community detection algorithm, combined with some network visualization tools, to determine whether the words used to describe these positions are really as different as their titles might indicate.\nHere is how to interpret the network visualization:\n\nSquares represent search terms that were used to find the job postings.\nCircles represent terms - qualifications (in the first network) or responsibilities (in the second) - that were listed in the job postings.\nLines connect search terms to the qualifications and responsibilities listed in the job postings. If there is a line between a circle and a square, that means that the qualification/responsibility (circle) was listed in a job posting discovered with that search term (square).\nColors represent search terms and qualifications/responsibilities that often appeared together, suggesting that the qualifications or responsibilities are similar within those search terms (squares). This is called a community, cluster, or group.\nClick on a search term (square) to reveal the associated qualifications or responsibilities (circles), and vice versa (click on a qualification to show associated search terms). For example, clicking on ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù reveals that statistics, regression, machine learning, and a master‚Äôs degree are commonly listed qualifications. Click any blank space on the figure to de-select.\nDrag or zoom the figure to see the network more clearly. Refresh the page to reset the network completely.\n\n\nA network of qualifications ‚Ä¶\n\n    \n\n\n\nA network visualization of qualifications associated with each search term.\n\n\nDepending on the algorithm I used, I found anywhere between 1 and 3 distinct groups of qualifications amongst the search terms. In this final iteration, we can see that there are three communities of listed qualifications.\n\nYellow Group - Math and Statistics: Primary qualifications explicitly reference math and statistics, as well as regression and R, the statistical programming language. These are jobs in deep learning, time series, and reinforcement learning.\n\nRed Group - High Experience: These jobs reference terms such as experience, skills, ‚Äúa related field‚Äù, and a master‚Äôs degree. These are more specialized jobs in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and blockchain.\nPurple Group - Computer Science Focused: References more software-focused programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala. These are jobs in big data and neural networks.\n\nIf you click on the nodes (circles/squares) of the network, you can see that even though distinct groups are formed, there is a lot of overlap in the qualifications. The main qualifications that are not covered in our program are the more software-oriented programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala.\n\n\n‚Ä¶ and a network of responsibilities\n\n\n    \n\n\n \n\nA network visualization of responsibilities associated with each search term.\n\n\nTurning our attention to the responsibilities listed in the job postings, we once again are left with three groups using this specific algorithm.\nMy impression of these groups is as follows:\n\nYellow Group - Client-Facing ML: Responsiblities include creating Machine Learning (ML) models, with an emphasis on providing value to customers. These are deep learning, data science, and machine learning jobs.\n\nRed Group - Technical-Managerial: Responsiblities that focus on training, management, and providing technical expertise. These jobs include big data and cloud Computing, blockchain, and more advanced reinforcement learning.\n\nPurple Group - Collaborative Development: This group references more ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô such as collaboration, development, and design. While these are still very technical positions such as neural networks and NLP, it often takes a big team to build these models!\n\nOverall, there is heavy overlap for the qualifications and responsibilities associated with each search term. The answer to the question ‚ÄúAre the qualifications and responsibilities for these jobs very different?‚Äù is: probably not. Fortunately, it looks like our program prepares us very well for the majority of these positions."

    "text": "üëë Do Great Responsibilities Bring Great Benefits?\nThe language in which a job opportunity is packaged varies greatly from company to company. Some postings are described extensively, while other simply list a few meager bullet points. The extent to which the amount of qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits reflect the true nature of a position is unclear. However, as a prospective applicant, my intuition would be that a job with more listed qualifications and responsibilities should also have more benefits. At the very least, one would expect companies that are more verbose in their recruitment would have more bullet points in each category: qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.\nTo answer this question, I tallied the number of bullet points in each category for all of the positions that listed values for all three and created the following visualization. Here‚Äôs how to interpret this plot:\n\nSize of the bubble represents the number of listed benefits.\nThe horizontal position, or x axis reflects the number of qualifications listed on the job posting.\nThe vertical position, or y axis marks the number of listed responsibilities.\nColor indicates which search term yielded that job posting.\nClick on the dropdown menu on the top left to filter by the search term.\nHover your mouse over a bubble to reveal more information about the job represented by the bubble!\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nA bubble plot representing the relationship between the number of qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits listed in a job posting.\n\n\nIn many cases, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be much of a relationship between the number of listed responsibilities, qualifications, and benefits. I admit that this is not the most rigorous way to analyze whether what employers desire in candidates is commensurate with the benefits offered. However, a disconnect between these three categories may pose a perceptual problem for employers who are trying to attract talent. For example, a prospective applicant might look at a job posting with 40 listed responsibilities and only 2 benefits - as one company did - and immediately decide not to apply to that position.\nIn the correlation matrix below:\n\nLabels on the left and bottom indicate the variable being measured.\nColor of the square indicates the strength of the relationship. Lighter, yellow colors indicate a stronger positive relationship, while darker, purple colors indicate a stronger negative relationship.\nNumbers in the squares represent the correlation between the two variables. Values closer to 1 indicate a stronger positive relationship, while values closer to -1 indicate a stronger negative relationship. Values close to zero indicate no relationship. The 1s in the diagonal represent the correlation of a variable with itself, which is always 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nA correlation matrix between the number of qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.\n\n\nLooking at the correlations between the three variables, we can see that the relationship differs by the job type. NLP jobs stand out with a solid 0.47 correlation between the number of listed benefits and qualifications. All other correlations are around the 0 to 0.3 range, except for time series which is misleading due to its sample size of 2.\nOut of the 823 job postings in our dataset, only 464 of them listed their benefits up front. In general, the number of listed requirements for a position are not matched by the number of benefits offered. The amount of information provided for each category should be considered by both employers and job applicants to better set expectations, facilitate greater transparency, and improve the hiring process for both parties."

    "section": "üó∫Ô∏è Mapping Salaries",
    "text": "üó∫Ô∏è Mapping Salaries\nContinuing with our theme of transparency, I imagine much consideration goes into whether a salary should be listed on a posting. According to LinkedIn, 91% of job seekers said seeing a salary range on a job posting affects their decision to apply for a job. In our sample, only 133 postings listed a salary range - approximately 15% of all jobs in the dataset.\nMost of the salaries are listed as a range with a minimum and a maximum. To visualize the range of salaries, I created a map of the job postings.\nIn the map below:\n\nCircles represent the salary of the position. The inner circle is scaled to the minimum salary, while the outer circle is scaled to the outer salary.\nClick on a circle to reveal more information about a job.\n\nScroll to zoom in on a region and see the individual jobs (try the DC metro area!).\nFilter the map and make the remote jobs visible by clicking the checkbox in the top right corner. Keep in mind that remote jobs are listed at random locations within the continental USA.\nNote that some jobs were hourly, and were converted to yearly salaries by multiplying the hourly wage by 2,080 (the approximate number of hours worked in a year). These are noted in the individual information box that pops up when you click on the circle.\nFurther note that locations only reflect the city and state listed in the posting, not actual addresses since they were not provided.\n\n\nRoom for Negotiation: A Map of Salary Ranges\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -> Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\nA map of the jobs that listed a salary.\n\n\nExamining this map, some trends become apparent. Most of the positions have a fair amount of room for negotiation. On average, the maximum salary is $35,000 or 61% more than the minimum salary, but there is considerable variance. For example, try to find the remote Fintech Recruiters job, with a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $500,000. A prospective applicant‚Äôs perception of a posting may be impacted by the listed range of a salary. A fixed salary might seem rigid and convey a sense of strict salary structure, whereas a position with a very broad range may seem confusing or too good to be true.\nWe can also see that in-person jobs tend to be similar within a region. Looking at San Francisco as an example, we can see that the salaries seem to be within the same approximate range of $100,000 - $250,000. Whether a salary is similar to other salaries in the region can also contribute to a prospective applicant‚Äôs decision to apply for the position. Jobs with salaries much lower than the regional standard may be completely passed over.\nChoosing whether to post a salary is a significant decision for an employer. I believe that listing a salary range is best; this sets expectations for the applicant and promotes fairness in negotiation. The talent pool available to the employer will also be larger, since more people will want to apply to a job that posts a salary within their desired range."

    "section": "üîé Conclusions",
    "text": "üîé Conclusions\nLet‚Äôs summarize the key insights from this mini-project:\n\nData science jobs are often called something other than ‚ÄúData Scientist.‚Äù Only 21 of the positions in our dataset actually had ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù in the job title. Despite using 11 different search terms, the qualifications and responsibilities for these categories heavily overlapped in our network analysis. Data science graduates should not hesitate to apply to positions that do not explicitly mention data science for fear of being unqualified.\nEmployers should be mindful of the types of information they provide for a job posting. There was not a strong relationship between the quantity of responsibilities/qualifications listed and the quantity of benefits listed. While I simply counted the number of bullet points, and those may not be a good proxy for the true value of the benefits, they may impact a job seeker‚Äôs perception. If tens of responsibilities are listed but few benefits, it may look like the job asks for more than it provides, and reduce interest in the job.\nListing a salary range on a job posting is an impactful decision. Job seekers can easily compare salaries to similar jobs in their area. If the salaries are significantly less than comparable positions, this will discourage applicants. Posting a salary range can convey a sense of flexibility and willingness to compensate based on individual factors. If the range is small, it could suggest a fixed salary structure that may be undesirable. Huge salary ranges may make the posting more confusing (maybe the company is hiring at different levels) - or worse, it could make the job posting seem like it is fake. On average, a maximum salary that is about 60% more than the minimum will seem reasonable.\n\nIn building this project, I‚Äôve learned a great deal about the types of jobs available to a data science graduate student like myself. I feel more confident in applying to jobs with unfamiliar titles. Finally, I am better equipped to know what to look for in a posting‚Äôs qualifications, responsibilities, benefits, and salary. Thanks for reading!"

Here are the main decisions:\n\nFinding locations and adding noise: Jobs were either remote (listed as ‚Äúanywhere‚Äù or ‚Äúunited states‚Äù), or they were listed at a location in city, state abbreviation format.\n\nFor remote jobs, coordinates were randomly assigned to a location in the continental US. A bounding box was created in GeoJSON for this purpose. Most of the remote jobs will appear in the central US, since drawing a bigger box often led to some jobs being located in the ocean. To avoid any confusion, the remote jobs are not displayed by default, so the user must click on the ‚Äúremote‚Äù box to show those jobs.\nFor in-person jobs, the coordinates were located using the nominatim API. Since a number of jobs were listed in the same city, I needed to add a small amount of noise to the coordinates to avoid overlap (about a tenth of a degree).\n\nYearly/Hourly: Some positions were listed as hourly wage jobs. These were converted into yearly salaries by multiplying the wage by 2,080, which is the approximate number of hours worked in a year for a full-time employee. This way, the jobs could be compared on the same scale.\nMarkers: The green markers were scaled to 1/5000 of the actual salary. The concentric circles were used to show a minimum and a maximum salary range. A popup was generated to provide more information about the position.\nThe map: The map was created with folium, and used a template called ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù to match the website aesthetic."
