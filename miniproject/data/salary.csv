With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

Graph neural networks professional or academic for 3d data,Upwork,Anywhere,via Upwork,"I would like to hire a professional or academic with experience in graph neural networks for detecting patterns in building 3d elements, the file type given is ifc and the extraction of the ifc data is producing data in tabular format for each building element, e.g. a wall is a row with certain properties as different columns. E.g. x,y,z centroid coordinates, volume, discipline (electrical or... hvac)

The goal is to apply GNN or GCN to find topological and property building element patterns for example a certain positioning and distancing between the electrical elements and the classification in different classes.

Along with this problem there are more similar problems that need to be solved in similar ways.

Here is the recent research paper that needs to be taken into account. The goal is not to outsource the project but to get advice on the technology, advice on the steps to do create the solution, consultation on the code with live sessions

Ionosphere Phase Estimation for InSAR Time Series Analyses,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institut,"Pasadena, CA",via Ladders,"Job Details

New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to... discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.

The Radar Science and Engineering section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to develop, implement, and test new algorithms to be adopted by the Observational Products for End-users using Remote sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to generate surface displacement products over North America.

The postdoc will help develop new ionosphere phase estimation and phase unwrapping algorithms to correct and improve the accuracy of remote sensing products derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The suitable candidate will also contribute to the verification of the displacement time-series algorithm over representative regions in North America covered by the OPERA displacement product.

The postdoc will contribute to:

• Develop and implement a new algorithm for correcting the ionosphere phase screen affecting InSAR time-series data using Total Electron Content maps derived from dual-frequency GNSS data.

• Test and quantify the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm on time series of C-band (e.g., Sentinel-1A/B) and L-band (e.g., NISAR) InSAR data and compare its performance with that from state-of-the-art methods (e.g., split-spectrum).

• Improve state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms to reduce unwrapping errors and computational runtime for fine resolution wrapped interferograms.

• Verify the selected OPERA’s surface displacement algorithm over North America with a focus on regions affected by significant temporal decorrelation changes (e.g., areas with snowfall).

• Publish outcomes in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.

The outcome of this investigation will inform the OPERA project algorithm development team on the ionosphere phase correction algorithm to adopt for generating OPERA displacement products.

Qualifications:

Applicants may have a PhD in:

• Electrical or telecommunication engineering

• Geomatics or environmental engineering

• Geophysics or related field

We seek a creative and highly motivated candidate with a strong background in SAR interferometry and SAR algorithm development, particularly in the field of repeat-pass and time-series interferometry. The candidate should have excellent oral and written communication skills.

The candidate must be detail-oriented and capable of working both independently and in close collaboration with others, and should have excellent abilities in programming with Python and preferably also C++.

Prior experience working with InSAR time series analysis, repeat-pass interferometry, and publication record in these fields are regarded as merits.

The appointee will be advised, and will collaborate with OPERA’s algorithm development team and OPERA’s project science team.

Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.

Data Extraction Program with OCR and Machine Learning,Upwork,Anywhere,via Upwork,"Job: Data Extraction program with OCR and machine learning

I need help to develop a program or script that can analyze dental insurance fee schedules, determine the fee for each dental procedure, and extract that information to a simple CSV file...

The scope of the work is to develop this program and deliver it for exclusive use by my company.

Input:

Pdf files that include dental procedure codes, procedure descriptions, and corresponding fees.

Output:

CSV file with a column for the procedure codes and corresponding fees. No formatting or special characters.

Challenges:

1. Fee schedules come from numerous insurance companies with variable formatting and a lot of extraneous information, images, dates, etc.

2. Fee schedules often have to be scanned from faxed documents with no embedded text and optical imperfections. The program will have to use OCR and learning, not simple text extraction.

3. The procedure descriptions can wrap onto multiple lines and the fees do not always line up in neat columns and rows. The program will have to recognize the descriptions and correctly align the corresponding fees.

4. The fees that we want to extract are sometimes labeled ""fees"", or ""maximum allowable charges"", or ""maximum allowable fees"" or ""discounted rates"" or ""member pays"", etc.

5. The output needs to be very accurate. If that is not possible due to limitations of OCR, I want the program to output a third column with a confidence interval so that a human manually checking the data could quickly determine which values had low confidence and may need to be corrected.

I will provide a few samples here but I have about 20 total schedules that generally represent the range of formats might be encountered.

Please let me know if this can be accomplished, your hourly rate, and an estimate of how many hours it would require to develop and train the program","['2 days ago', '12–30 an hour', 'Work from home', 'Contractor']",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,"['The program will have to use OCR and learning, not simple text extraction', 'If that is not possible due to limitations of OCR, I want the program to output a third column with a confidence interval so that a human manually checking the data could quickly determine which values had low confidence and may need to be corrected']","['I need help to develop a program or script that can analyze dental insurance fee schedules, determine the fee for each dental procedure, and extract that information to a simple CSV file', 'Pdf files that include dental procedure codes, procedure descriptions, and corresponding fees', 'CSV file with a column for the procedure codes and corresponding fees', 'Fee schedules come from numerous insurance companies with variable formatting and a lot of extraneous information, images, dates, etc', 'Fee schedules often have to be scanned from faxed documents with no embedded text and optical imperfections', 'The fees that we want to extract are sometimes labeled ""fees"", or ""maximum allowable charges"", or ""maximum allowable fees"" or ""discounted rates"" or ""member pays"", etc']",,"{'link': 'http://www.elance.com/', 'text': 'elance.com'}","{'link': 'https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&q=Upwork&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirjPvY7bH-AhXDsVYBHbGuD444FBCYkAII1ww', 'text': 'See web results for Upwork'}",Contractor,True,2 days ago,12–30 an hour,machine learning,USA,,,2.0,6.0,,12.0,30.0,an hour
