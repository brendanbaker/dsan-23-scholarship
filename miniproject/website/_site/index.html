<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">ü§ù Introduction</h2>
<p>The present state of the economy (as of May 2023) is uncertain at best, with some bearish voices warning of recession while others claim it‚Äôs business as usual. A recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/are-we-in-a-recession/">Forbes advisor article</a> tracked 15 performance metrics and rated 3 as good, 4 as neutral, and 8 as bad. Two consumer confidence surveys were listed - one rated good, the other rated bad. A recent <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/are-we-in-a-recession">nerdwallet</a> article dated May 3rd plainly states ‚ÄúAccording to a traditional definition, the U.S. is not currently in a recession.‚Äù</p>
<p>While I am not an economist, I am interested in understanding the current state of job market for data scientists, since I will need to find a job after I graduate. Before breaking out the machine learning algorithms to try and predict where the economy is going (maybe later!), I think using the data provided for our vizualization mini-project might give us a sense of how the data science market looks like right now. At the very least, I hope to answer a few questions that I‚Äôve had when trying to navigate job postings.</p>
<p>The data provided for this mini-project comes from a web-crawling exercise that involved 11 different search terms on April 14th, 2023. These search terms were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data scientist</code></li>
<li><code>data analyst</code></li>
<li><code>neural networks</code></li>
<li><code>big data and cloud computing</code></li>
<li><code>machine learning</code></li>
<li><code>reinforcement learning</code></li>
<li><code>deep learning</code></li>
<li><code>time series</code></li>
<li><code>block chain</code></li>
<li><code>natural language processing</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The searches were also divided into two categories based on their location: nationwide, and here in Washington, D.C. You can see a sample job posting below:</p>
<img src="./pics/jobposting.png" class="img-fluid" alt="An example job posting."> <font size="2">
<center>
<em>Screenshot of an example job posting. Many postings list abundant qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.</em>
</center>
</font><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>There were a total of 823 unique job postings. From these postings, there were 458 unique job titles, which leads me to my first question.</p>
</section>
<section id="untangling-the-web-of-job-titles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="untangling-the-web-of-job-titles">üï∏Ô∏è Untangling The Web of Job Titles</h2>
<p>Given the vast number of job titles - and 11 different search categories - I wondered which jobs I might qualify for with my degree. I‚Äôve often heard that data science graduates are prepared for a wide variety of jobs, and not to limit oneself only to jobs entitled ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù. To this end, I focused on the ‚ÄúQualifications‚Äù and ‚ÄúResponsibilities‚Äù sections of a the job posting. I used a community detection algorithm, combined with some network visualization tools, to determine whether the words used to describe these positions are really as different as the titles might indicate.</p>
<section id="a-network-of-qualifications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-network-of-qualifications">A network of qualifications ‚Ä¶</h3>
<div class="iframes-container">
    <iframe allowtransparency="true" style="background: #272838;" src="./viz/textnet_qualifications.html" frameborder="0" width="815" height="815"></iframe>
</div>
<font size="2">
<center>
<em>Note that you can click on the shapes to highlight its connections, then move and zoom the chart as needed for clarity. Squares represent search terms, while circles represent noun phrases associated with that search term.</em>
</center>
</font><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Depending on the algorithm I used, I found anywhere between 1 and 3 distinct groups of qualifications amongst the search terms. In this final iteration, we can see that there are three communities of listed qualifications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Group -</strong> <em>Math and Statistics:</em> Primary qualifications explicitly reference math and statistics, as well as regression and R, our favorite statistical programming language. These are deep learning, time series, and reinforcement learning jobs.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Red Group -</strong> <em>High Experience:</em> These jobs reference experience, skills, ‚Äòa related field‚Äô, and a master‚Äôs degree. These are more specialized machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and block chain jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Purple Group -</strong> <em>Computer Science Heavy:</em> References more software-focused programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala. These are the big data and neural networks jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you click on the nodes (circles/squares) of the network, you can see that even though these groups are formed, there is a lot of overlap in the qualifications. The main qualifications that are not covered in out program are the more software-oriented programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala.</p>
</section>
<section id="and-a-network-of-responsibilities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="and-a-network-of-responsibilities">‚Ä¶ and a network of responsibilities</h3>
<div class="iframes-container">

    <iframe allowtransparency="true" style="background: #272838;" src="./viz/textnet_responsibilities.html" frameborder="0" width="815" height="815"></iframe>

</div>
<br> <font size="2">
<center>
<em>We can see that the responsibilities listed in the job postings also form 3 similar groups.</em>
</center>
</font><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Turning out attention to the responsibilities listed in the job postings, we once again are left with three groups using this specific algorithm (for anyone familiar with network science, it is a Reichardt and Bornholdt‚Äôs Potts model).</p>
<p>My impression of these groups is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Group -</strong> <em>Client-Facing ML:</em> Responsiblities include creating Machine Learning (ML) models, with an emphasis on providing value to customers. These are Deep Learning, Data Science, and Machine Learning jobs.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Red Group -</strong> <em>Technical-Managerial:</em> Responsiblities that focus on training, management, and providing technical expertise. These jobs include Big Data and Cloud Computing, Block Chain, and more advanced Reinforcement Learning.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Purple Group -</strong> <em>Collaborative Development:</em> This group references more ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô such as collaboration, development, and design. While these are still very technical positions such as Neural Networks and NLP, it often takes a big team to build these models!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, there is heavy overlap for the qualifications and responsibilities associated with each search term. The answer to the question ‚ÄúAre the qualifications and responsibilities for these jobs very different?‚Äù is: <em>probably not.</em> Fortunately, it looks like our program prepares us very well for the majority of these positions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="great-responsibilities-great-benefits">ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Great Responsibilities, Great Benefits?</h2>
<p>The language in which a job opportunity is packaged varies greatly from company to company. Some postings are described extensively, while other simply list a few meagre bullet points. The extent to which the amount of qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits reflect the true nature of a position is unclear. However, as a prospective applicant, my intuition would be that a job with more listed qualifications and responsibilities should also have more benefits. At the very least, one would expect companies that are more verbose in their recruitment would have more bullet points in each category: qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.</p>
<p>To answer this question, I tallied the number of bullet points in each category for all of the positions that listed values for all three:</p>

<em>In this plot, the size of the bubble is scaled to the number of listed responsibilities. The position on the bottom (x) axis reflects the number of qualifications listed on the job posting, while the position on the left (y) axis marks the number of listed responsibilities. Use the dropdown menu on the top left to filter by the type of job, and mouse over a bubble to reveal more information about that position!</em>

<p>In many cases, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be much of a relationship between the number of listed responsibilities, qualifications, and benefits. I admit that this is not the most rigorous way to analyze whether what employers desire in candidates is commensurate with their benefits, however this may pose a perceptual problem for employers who are trying to attract talent. For example, a prospective applicant might look at a job posting with 40 listed responsibilities and only 2 benefits - as one company did - and immediately decide not to apply to that position.</p>

<em>A correlation matrix between the number of qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.</em>
</center>
</font><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Looking at the correlations between the three variables, we can see that the relationship differs by the job type. NLP jobs stand out with a solid 0.47 correlation between the number of listed benefits and qualifications. All other correlations are around the 0 to 0.3 range, except for time series which is misleading due to its sample size of 2.</p>
<p>Out of the 823 job postings in our dataset, only 464 of them listed their benefits up front. In general, the number of listed requirements for a position are not matched by the number of benefits offered. The amount of information provided for each category should be considered by both employers and job applicants to better set expectations, facilitate greater transparency, and improve the hiring process for both parties.</p>

<p>Continuing with our theme of transparency, I imagine much consideration goes into whether a salary should be listed on a posting. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/why-you-should-include-salary-ranges-in-job-posts#:~:text=New%20research%20shows%20what%20many,affect%20their%20decision%20to%20apply.">LinkedIn</a>, 91% of job seekers said seeing a salary range on a job posting affects their decision to apply for a job. In our sample, only 133 postings listed a salary range - only about 15%.</p>
