## Introduction

The present state of the economy (as of May 2023) is uncertain at best, with some bearish voices warning of recession while others claim it's business as usual.  A recent [Forbes advisor article](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/are-we-in-a-recession/) tracked 15 performance metrics and rated 3 as good, 4 as neutral, and 8 as bad.  Two consumer confidence surveys were listed - one rated good, the other rated bad.  A recent [nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/are-we-in-a-recession) article dated May 3rd plainly states "According to a traditional definition, the U.S. is not currently in a recession."  

While I am not an economist, I am interested in understanding the current state of job market for data scientists, since I will need to find a job after I graduate.  Before breaking out the machine learning algorithms to try and predict where the economy is going (maybe later!), I think using the data provided for our vizualization mini-project might give us a sense of how the data science market looks like right now.  At the very least, I hope to answer a few questions that I've had when trying to navigate job postings.  

The data provided for this mini-project comes from a web-crawling exercise that involved 11 different search terms on April 14th, 2023.  These search terms were:

 * `data scientist`
 * `data analyst`
 * `neural networks`
 * `big data and cloud computing`
 * `machine learning`
 * `reinforcement learning`
 * `deep learning`
 * `time series`
 * `block chain`
 * `natural language processing`

The searches were also divided into two categories based on their location: nationwide, and here in Washington, D.C.  You can see a sample job posting below:

<font size='2'><center>*An example job posting.  Many postings list abundant qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits.*</center></font>
 
There were a total of 823 unique job postings.  From these postings, there were 458 unique job titles, which leads me to my first question. 

## Untangling the web of job titles 

Given the vast number of job titles - and 11 different search categories - I wondered which jobs I might qualify for with my degree.  I've often heard that data science graduates are prepared for a wide variety of jobs, and not to limit oneself only to jobs entitled "Data Scientist".  To this end, I focused on the "Qualifications" and "Responsibilities" sections of a the job posting.  I used a community detection algorithm, combined with some network visualization tools, to determine whether the words used to describe these positions are really as different as the titles might indicate. 


### A network of qualifications ...

</div>
```
<font size='2'><center>*Note that you can click on the shapes to highlight its connections, then move and zoom the chart as needed for clarity.  Squares represent search terms, while circles represent noun phrases associated with that search term.*</center></font>

Depending on the algorithm I used, I found anywhere between 1 and 3 distinct groups of qualifications amongst the search terms.  In this final iteration, we can see that there are three communities of listed qualifications.  
 
 * **Yellow Group -** *Math and Statistics:*  Primary qualifications explicitly reference math and statistics, as well as regression and R, our favorite statistical programming language.  These are deep learning, time series, and reinforcement learning jobs.  
 * **Red Group -** *High Experience:*  These jobs reference experience, skills, 'a related field', and a master's degree.  These are more specialized machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and block chain jobs. 
 * **Purple Group -** *Computer Science Heavy:*  References more software-focused programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala.  These are the big data and neural networks jobs.

If you click on the nodes (circles/squares) of the network, you can see that even though these groups are formed, there is a lot of overlap in the qualifications.  The main qualifications that are not covered in out program are the more software-oriented programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala. 

### ... and a network of responsibilities
```{=html }
<div class="iframes-container">

    <iframe allowtransparency="true" style="background: #272838;" src="./viz/textnet_responsibilities.html" frameborder="0" width="815" height="815" ></iframe>

</div>
```
<font size='2'><center>*We can see that the responsibilities listed in the job postings also form 3 similar groups.*</center></font>

Turning out attention to the responsibilities listed in the job postings, we once again are left with three groups using this specific algorithm (for anyone familiar with network science, it is a Reichardt and Bornholdtâ€™s Potts model).

My impression of these groups is as follows: 

 * **Yellow Group -** *Client-Facing ML:*  Responsiblities include creating Machine Learning (ML) models, with an emphasis on providing value to customers.  These are Deep Learning, Data Science, and Machine Learning jobs.  
 * **Red Group -** *Technical-Managerial:*  Responsiblities that focus on training, management, and providing technical expertise.  These jobs include Big Data and Cloud Computing, Block Chain, and more advanced Reinforcement Learning.  
 * **Purple Group -** *Collaborative Development:*  This group references more 'soft skills' such as collaboration, development, and design.  While these are still very technical positions such as Neural Networks and NLP, it often takes a big team to build these models!

Overall, there was heavy overlap for each qualifications and responsibilities associated with each search term.  The answer to the question "Are the qualifications and responsibilities for these jobs very different?" is: *probably not.*
